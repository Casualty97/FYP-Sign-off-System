# Digital tree (2D and 3D)

**Owner:** Role 2, Wei Jie

**Where the code is**

- backend/features/tree/routes.js
- frontend/tree/, frontend/3dTree/
- frontend/admin/js/tree.js (Digital Tree Adjustment tab) and the leaf / background / vip-leaf / treeParameters routes still inside backend/features/admin/routes.js

**What it does**

The wall display. /api/tree returns this year's visitors as leaves; tree.js places them around the trunk, animates falling leaves and VIP gold leaves, and polls for new feedback. The admin tab controls growth stage, backgrounds, leaf images and the title box. /3dtree is only served when the admin switches the display mode to 3D.

**Task-sheet items for this feature**

- 3D tree animation with a moving leaf container; smoother 2D animation; replace or enhance the 4 growth stages.
- New leaf appears at the bottom centre for 10 to 15 s before joining the tree.
- Event-driven refresh instead of polling.
- Corrected pulse screen layout (deliverables list).

**Known issues (from the October 2026 review, line numbers refer to the layout before the restructure where noted)**

- 3D page never draws a leaf: 3dTree.js has the tree-image line commented out (3dTree.js 112 / 865).
- 3D page ignores title box and VIP settings; VIP folder name vip_leaf should be vip-leaf (3dTree.js 315, 1133).
- model-viewer only from a Google CDN, no fallback (3dTree.html 7).
- Live tree polls every 5 s regardless of leafRefreshInterval, 4 requests and a full rebuild each time (tree.js 2042).
- Auto growth stage is computed once when the admin saves; nothing re-evaluates it as leaves arrive (the thresholds are stored and reloaded into the form since 31 Oct).
- Empty number boxes save 0 and the wall uses hidden defaults (admin/js/parameters.js + tree.js 411).
- Tree keeps archived rows that pulse and pledgeboard hide (treeRoutes 112).
- Default background path wrong in parameters/store.js 185 (black wall on a fresh install).
- param-tintDurationHours input missing so the badge tint duration is always 0.
