# Review status (October 2026 code review)

Every problem the 30–31 Oct 2026 review found, grouped by the role that owns the code, with whether it is fixed.
Line numbers marked "old" refer to the one-file layout before the restructure (adminRoutes.js, admin.js, feedback.js);
the others refer to the current files. When you fix something, change its status to `fixed` and add the commit.

Commits so far: `a03bbeb` CI-flagged fixes, `02240df` dotenv, `4609ec9` admin batch 1, `e71ff16` admin batch 2,
`0d57c1c` core batch 3. The feature pages in `docs/features/` carry the same open items per feature.

## Role 3, Jun Kai (admin page, admin routes, archive and export, email, analysis, server control, themes, core)

| Status | Area | Problem | Where | Fixed in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fixed | admin routes | DELETE /feedback/:id deleted the visitor's `users` row, so every feedback of that visitor went with it | routes.js (old 1699) | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | admin routes | feedback delete trusted an `x-username` header the page never sent | old 1619 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | parameters | GET /parameters returned 3 of 14 groups, so Save Parameters blanked the other 11; the shipped defaults file carried the damage (25 values restored) | old 6485 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | archive | /download-file/:filename had no auth and allowed path traversal | old 2886 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | server control | probeKioskHttp called back twice (timeout then error), which could crash server.js | old 7894 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | email | PUT /email-config saved before validating; a rejected config stayed saved | old 7255 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | email | POST /email-config/test reported success on failure | old 7272 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | server control | /server/mode `updated_by` was always "unknown" | old 8601 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | tree admin | custom leaf and VIP leaf were saved under one fixed name, so Revert did nothing | old 850, 8094 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | parameters | leaf, background and VIP-leaf uploads had no multer error handler | old 6534, 6575, 8119 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | archive | duplicate POST /data-export/unlock (the admin router copy answered first) | old 4082 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | audit | logAudit whitelist dropped most actions (every config change); text ids went into the INT `target_id` column | old 554 | 4609ec9 |
| fixed | admin page | the 401 interceptor logged you out when you mistyped a password in the decrypt, export or delete prompts | core.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | background polls reset the inactivity timer, so the 30-minute auto-logout could never fire | core.js, kioskReload.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | moving the mouse closed the session warning modal before you could click Stay | core.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | the logout audit request was cancelled by the page reload | core.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | archive decrypt buttons were toggled by ids that do not exist | core.js | e71ff16 |

| fixed | admin page | opening Feedback Data started the (hidden) report's AI analysis | navigation.js | e71ff16 |

| fixed | admin page | Lost & Found and Parameter Adjustment were shown to non-admins, who got "Access denied" | core.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | Q&A View called GET /feedback/:id/questions, which never existed; yes/no answers rendered "No" | pledgeViewer.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | pledge View broke on any pledge with an apostrophe | feedback.js, archive.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | column sort was discarded by every filter change while the arrow stayed | feedback.js, archive.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | admin page | a dashboard stat of 0 leaked a never-ending 16 ms interval | dashboard.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | analysis | sentiment timeline bucketed by UTC day, not the Singapore day | analysis.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | audit | audit-log date presets used the UTC date ("Today" was yesterday before 8 am) | lostFound.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | archive | archive photo popups always said "Feedback not found"; downloads were always .jpg | photos.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | archive | data export forced the password on every visit although the unlock lasts 30 min | dataExport.js | e71ff16 |
| fixed | archive | feedback delete verified the password by calling /login (fake LOGIN audit rows); now POST /verify-password | feedbackDeletion.js | e71ff16 |

| fixed | users | the self-edit form passed an argument the handler no longer accepted | users.js | e71ff16 |

| fixed | server control | Windows Start reported failure after 1.5 s although the kiosk was starting | routes.js (old 8312) | e71ff16 |
| fixed | archive | data-export audit-log threw inside the DB callback and exited server.js | exportRoutes.js 304 | e71ff16 |
| fixed | archive | photo ZIP export had no archiver error listener and resolved before the stream ended | exportRoutes.js 889 | e71ff16 |

| fixed | core | db.js "transactions" ran START TRANSACTION and COMMIT on random pooled connections | core/db.js | 0d57c1c |
| fixed | core | boot exited on the first cold-start MySQL timeout | core/db.js | 0d57c1c |
| fixed | core | no listen error handler, so a port clash took both servers down | server.js, kioskServer.js | 0d57c1c |

| fixed | admin routes | users_today used CURDATE() (UTC day) | routes.js | 0d57c1c |

| fixed | core | backend/.env was never loaded by startAll.js | server.js, kioskServer.js | 02240df |
| open | themes | Save Theme always fails: it reads hex-* inputs that no longer exist; card swatches always grey | themes.js | |
| open | users | soft-deleted admins can still log in | core/auth.js 258 | |
| open | audit | several routes write the audit row before the auth or password check; EDIT_USER names the target as the actor | old 3545, 3647, 4182, 4368, 4516, 4738, 5090, 3850 | |
| open | archive | archive hard-delete unlinks the photos before the SQL DELETE and has no transaction | old 3053, 3203 | |
| open | archive | /archive/delete-selected and the export downloads answer 401 on a wrong password (should be 403) | routes.js, exportRoutes.js | |
| open | analysis | engine failures are cached as "neutral" forever; Ollama failures show nothing in the admin page | old 2426 | |
| open | analysis | cacheStore never persists hit statistics and rewrites the whole JSON cache every run | analysis/cacheStore.js 404 | |
| open | analysis | /feedback-sentiment-analysis downloads a 164 MB model and has no auth | routes.js | |
| open | admin routes | three queries use a `feedback.rating` column that does not exist | old 1399, 4252, 4345 | |
| open | archive | auto-archive never runs when the PC hibernates every night | old 6466 | |
| open | archive | temporary retention is dead end-to-end; the clean-up re-processes the same legacy rows from both servers | archive/retention.js 149 | |
| open | archive | CSV export turns 0 into a blank, has no formula neutralisation and prints raw Date strings | exportRoutes.js 974 | |
| open | email | initEmailService always reports success | email/service.js 1085 | |
| open | email | transport reloads only in the server.js process; the kiosk server keeps stale credentials; custom provider insists on user and password | email/service.js | |
| open | email | the visitor name is inserted raw into the thank-you HTML | email/service.js 1281 | |
| open | parameters | settings files are written non-atomically; a corrupt parametersConfig.json is silently replaced by the defaults | parameters/store.js 248 | |
| fixed | server control | schedules were CRUD only; nothing executed them on Windows. Now: scheduler + Windows wake timer (feature A) | backend/features/serverControl/ | hibernation feature, 31 Oct |
| fixed | server control | the page rejected overnight schedules (stop before start now means the next day) | serverControl.js | hibernation feature, 31 Oct |

| open | server control | restart-app.bat and startup-monitor.bat can double-launch the servers | project root | |
| open | core | only 39 of about 108 admin routes use auth.requireAuth; the router is mounted with no guard | server.js 409 | |
| open | core | static files are served before the page gates, so /tree/tree.html bypasses the 2D/3D and mobile gates | server.js 409 | |
| fixed | core | getSelectedIP fell back to the first adapter (VMware) unless one was named "Wi-Fi 2"; virtual adapters are now skipped | server.js 227 | hibernation feature, 31 Oct |
| open | core | kioskServer.js drifted from server.js (no page gates, different static handling) | kioskServer.js | |
| open | scripts | Simulation_Generator stores bare filenames and needs pngjs, which is not installed; Purge_Actuator leaves photos and tables behind | scripts/setup | |
| open | archive | the export unlock now goes through auth.loginUser, which bumps last_login on every unlock (minor) | exportRoutes.js 128 | |

- Tablet HTTPS certificate, the wall-PC runbook and seed data are planned, not bugs.
